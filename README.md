# API Endpoint Testing


Anyways...This Go script makes a request to everyendpoint in routes.txt
These were obtained from the openapi.json file included


What's the point?
This was inspired by [Kiterunner](https://github.com/assetnote/kiterunner). Though that tool is neat, it's complex
and not as easy to use as something like [SQL Map](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap), or [Go Buster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster).

Eventually, with this script, you should be able to do Enumeration, discovery,
and test access & endpoints, etc..



- you'll need this python script for easy parsing of OpenAPI Spec docs
either in yml or json: https://github.com/amalmurali47/swagroutes
